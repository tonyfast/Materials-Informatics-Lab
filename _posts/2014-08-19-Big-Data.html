## Collaboration

Modern science is innately collaborative.  Collaboration
enables researchers with complimentary skills to address highly constrained engineering
and scientific problems.  Many will claim that collaboration is a fundamental short
coming in research science, but I contend that educating users on best practices
in collaboration really is the struggle.  In this course, I hope teach the students
to make their ideas more permeable to their colleagues and their community at large.

Collaborative research science is a complex process that introduces non-technical
 challenges.  Typically changes of theory, direction,
 coding, experimentation, and other individual activities can be complicated by
 working with others.  In the past it was easy to work with a tight knit group of
 colleagues who's raport could simply drive a collaboration.  Currently, the fluidity
 in collaboration is complicated by information sharing.  We as a community
 are contributing to and sitting on top of an immovable mass of legacy materials data.

## Big Data as Hierarchy of Needs

In modern science, collaborations are typically driven by the transfer of data and its big.

The V's of Big Data

* Volume
* Velocity
* Variety
* Veracity
* Value

### A Verbose Big Data Hierarchy of Needs

A [hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) requires that its bases are satisfied before advancing up in layers.
For Big Data, this requires that the value of data can not be assessed before its truth.
The truth and value of the data require both fluid verbal and digital lexicons amongst a group
of diverse specialists; sound familiar to peer review?  A
[DOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model") or
[API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application Programming Interface")
indicates a sort of digital lexicon.  It follows that Big Data can be split into
technical (rational) and non-technical (irrational) categories.

**Variety** in Big Data (IMO) is an abstraction that is incomplete.  Big Data is big because many 
agents contribute to growth and existence.  Many agents implies that the Variety is not only in the Typing of Data,
but also in the language that the Data is discussed.  **Variety** can by split into in *technical* and *non-technical* categories.
Addressing questions on the *irrational* spectrum of Big Data requires the input of many agents 
and their personalities.  **Variety in Lexicon** intimates at a language problem; the language
Language can pose one of the most substantial challenges in agreement on peer reviewed ideas.
Language is a consideration in the variety block of Big Data.  Language takes time to mature.
At its earliest stages, it is a clumsy pidgin language that can grow into a formalized creole.
Our language for building cross-disciplinary collaborations in  Big Materials Data will take time
to grow.  I contend that digital conversation in materials science will empower researchers
to work more freely and contribute to the knowledge pool of materials science effectively.

### [Rational versus Irrational Agents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent)

Rational and Irrational agents are a product of [Behavioral Economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics)
which is an thriving sector of data science.
An enormous unconstrained challenge in Big Data is the intersection of its rational
and irrational components.  **Rational** data considerations are of the technical
flavor.  There are often optimal or at least acceptable to solutions to dealing with
the volume, velocity, and typing variety of data.  **Irrational** complications in
big data exist on a peer-to-peer level.  They take into
account an agents experience, lexicon, personality, bias, and idiosyncracies in their research.  It is not
always easy to find a formidable colleague to address a research challenge.  This is not for a lack
of need or want, but moreso that [*soft skills*](http://data-informed.com/soft-skills-matter-data-science/) are not a control in collaborative research science.

## On Transparency

> _**My Thoughts**_: Peer review publication takes inordinate amount of time to share, often,
uncertain results.  The current societal pressures on the engineering sciences will continue to
stockpile until an improved model for dissemating research results exists.  I promote a broad dissemination
of research during the research process.  Contributions from the community can drive
work in high-valued research directions and prevent an extra expenditure in energy when
proofing and revising research.  Scientific research needs a more [agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) bent on it.

Increasingly, access to research information is being demanded by both the government,
industry, and the public scientific community.  Recent examples indicate that
[The Corruption of Peer Review Is Harming Scientific Credibility](http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/hank-campbell-the-corruption-of-peer-review-is-harming-scientific-credibility-1405290747-lMyQjAxMTA0MDEwNDE).
The mar of other scientists are having a strong impact on the public's and science's opinion of scientific research.
As a result, there is a strong need for fluid information access and reproducible scientific research.  Hiding our scars
is adverse to the community.

Efforts to create standards for [Research Data](https://rd-alliance.org/), [Digital Object Identifiers](http://www.doi.org/), and [Persistent Uniform Research Locator](http://purl.oclc.org/docs/index.html) allows
users to confidently share their information while recieving credit.
