## Objectives of Materials Informatics Lab

The first class will focus on some basic ideas to streamline your research with your
collaborators.  There will be a strong focus on the diversity of scientific research in hopes of
communicating the implicit need for each researcher's strengths.  Analyzing
and streamlining your workflows is important to your career beyond technical merit.  Efficiencies 
will afford researchers more freedom to garner there ideas while they are
not muddling through conventional research drudgeries.

> What are some annoying aspects of collaboration?  Anyone else hate paperwork?

Derived research information is expected to relevent outside of your immediate collaboration network; [science is a public good](http://www.sciencebusiness.net/pdfs/innovationboard/Scientific_Knowledge_-_Haskel_Imperial_College.pdf).
The guard of public science is a sluggish peer review process.  The peer review process sources knowledge from experts 
in a domain to vet the value and truthfulness of scientific research.  In this course, we are looking to test
the value of *in situ* publishing methods and organic discussion along the entire continuum of the research process.  We will focus on how our research appears to our collaborators,
colleagues, and community.  When performing research it is critical to ask yourself

> What does my research look like and how accessible is it?

### *Note*

Each course post and project will enable some form of commenting.  Comments will be
served by either Github or Disqus.  Personal emails will be accepted, but questions
pertaining to research, homework, and course content will be semi-open and available through public links.


## Deliverables for Today

For those who have completed these tasks before, I would like to ask you to assist
the other students as they go through the process.  Through having the students teach
each other I hope to reinforce important pieces in collaboration that require you to
educate others.

### Deliverables Task List

* Sign up for necessary course accounts
  * [Github](https://www.github.com) *Don't forget to link an email*
  * [Disqus](https://www.disqus.com)
  * [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net)
  * some cloud storage
* Navigate Github

  Learn to explore Github Repositories and Github Issues along with satellite
  Github programs like [Github Education](https://education.github.com), [Gists](https://gists.github.com),
  and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
  
* Establish a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com) for each student in the class.

  Github pages will be used to access, publish, and share the users individual efforts in the class.  Github 
  pages can serve as your personal webpage and we will learn to use it effectively together.
  
* Upload a short presentation to Slideshare

  Slideshare allows each person to easily share Prezi, Powerpoint, and Infographics with colleagues and the community.
  
* Spin up our first course webpage.
